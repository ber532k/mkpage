# Main page

This will be the landing page for your site. Remember that it doesn't have to
be written in markdown. You could also write it in `html5` and save it as
`src/index.html`, or in latex ans save it as `src/index.tex`. Note however,
that only one file is supposed to match `src/index.*`, otherwise any file
producing a match could end up providing the source code for `out/index.html`
